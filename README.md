# 🌌 Cosmic-Sim: An Interactive Universe Simulation

A cinematic, interactive 3D simulation of the universe's origins, from the Planck Epoch to the first stars. This project is built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and GSAP to create a beautiful and educational experience.

## 🌀 Fun Extras & Cosmic Detours

This simulation also includes additional routes exploring other complex concepts:

* **/blackhole:** An interactive 3D model of a black hole.
* **/tesseract:** A visualization of a four-dimensional tesseract.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

The goal is to simulate all seven major events in the universe's timeline:

1.  [x] **Planck Epoch** (The vibrating point)
2.  [x] **Cosmic Inflation** (The violent expansion)
3.  [x] **Quark-Gluon Plasma** (The "particle soup")
4.  [x] **Nucleosynthesis** (Protons and neutrons form)
5.  [x] **Recombination** (The "First Light")
6.  [x] **The Dark Ages** (A vast, dark void)
7.  [x] **First Stars Ignite** (The darkness ends)
