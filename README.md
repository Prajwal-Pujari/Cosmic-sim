# 🌌 Cosmic-Sim: An Interactive Universe Simulation

A cinematic, interactive 3D simulation of the universe's origins, from the Planck Epoch to the first stars. This project is built with Next.js, React Three Fiber, and GSAP to create a beautiful and educational experience.




---

## 🚀 Current Status

This project is in active development. The simulation currently includes:
* **The Planck Epoch:** A representation of the initial singularity and the chaotic "quantum foam."
* **Cosmic Inflation:** A violent, cinematic expansion event with post-processing "shockwave" effects.
* **Interactive Info Panels:** Clickable 3D objects that fetch data from a local JSON "API" and the live NASA Image API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project uses a modern, high-performance web stack:
* **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React)
* **3D Graphics:** [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) (R3F)
* **3D Helpers:** [React Three Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
* **Animation:** [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) (for "cinematic" timeline control)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **Effects:** [React Postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-postprocessing) (for Bloom, Chromatic Aberration, etc.)
* **Language:** TypeScript

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

The goal is to simulate all seven major events in the universe's timeline:

1.  [x] **Planck Epoch** (The vibrating point)
2.  [x] **Cosmic Inflation** (The violent expansion)
3.  [x] **Quark-Gluon Plasma** (The "particle soup")
4.  [ ] **Nucleosynthesis** (Protons and neutrons form)
5.  [ ] **Recombination** (The "First Light")
6.  [ ] **The Dark Ages** (A vast, dark void)
7.  [ ] **First Stars Ignite** (The darkness ends)
